# Movie-Recommender-Web-App
The client (Angular) gets a list of movies to rate from the server (Spring Boot) and sends the posts the ratings back. It is then redirected to the recommendations page where it gets a list of recommended movies from the server

1. Run both the client and the server
2. Go to localhost:4200/movies
3. Rate movies on scale from 0 to 10 (highest) and submit the ratings
4. Be redirected to the recommendations page
